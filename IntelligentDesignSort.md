# Intelligent Design Sort

## Description

Intelligent Design Sort is a tongue-in-cheek "algorithm" based on the idea of intelligent design. It operates under the assumption that, given the sheer improbability of the input array being in the state that it's in by random chance, the array must have been arranged in that particular order by an intelligent agent. Thus, the algorithm concludes that the array is already optimally sorted in some way that transcends human understanding, and no further action is required.

## Time Complexity

- **Best**: O(1), as it assumes the array is already sorted by an intelligent cause.
- **Average**: O(1), for the same reason.
- **Worst**: O(1), because the algorithm does not actually perform any sorting operations.

## Space Complexity

- **Worst**: O(1) auxiliary

No additional space is used by the algorithm, as it operates under the belief that the array is already in a state of perfect order.

## Stability

- Stable

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
procedure intelligentDesignSort(A : array of items)
    /* Assume the array was created by an intelligent designer */
    /* Hence, it's already sorted in a perfect manner */
    return A
end procedure
```
