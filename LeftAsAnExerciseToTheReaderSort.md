# Left To The Reader As Exercise Sort

## Description

Left To The Reader As Exercise Sort is a non-algorithm that playfully shifts the responsibility of sorting to the reader. The premise is that the best way to learn is by doing, so rather than sorting the array itself, the algorithm invites the reader to sort the array manually as an educational exercise.

## Time Complexity

- **Best**: O(1), since it returns the array without altering it.
- **Average**: O(1), because no sorting action is performed.
- **Worst**: O(1), for the same reasons.

## Space Complexity

- **Worst**: O(1) auxiliary

This "algorithm" does not use any additional space beyond the input array.

## Stability

- Stable

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
procedure leftToTheReaderAsExerciseSort(A : array of items)
    // Sorting is left as an exercise to the reader.
    // No action is performed on the array itself.
    return A
end procedure
```
