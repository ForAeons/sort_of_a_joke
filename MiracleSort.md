# Miracle Sort

## Description

Miracle Sort is a whimsical sorting algorithm that relies on the hope of a miraculous event to sort an array. Upon invocation, it optimistically assumes that a serendipitous anomaly might occur, causing the elements of the array to fall into perfect order. The 'algorithm' is executed with the expectation that the universe's natural entropy will reverse, just this once, for the specific purpose of sorting your array.

## Time Complexity

- **Best**: O(1), assuming a miracle occurs instantaneously.
- **Average**: Undefined, as it relies on a supernatural occurrence.
- **Worst**: Also undefined, as the wait for a miracle could be eternal.

## Space Complexity

- **Worst**: O(1) auxiliary

Miracle Sort operates in place and requires no additional space, as it does not perform any standard sorting operations.

## Stability

- Not applicable

## Pseudo Code

```plaintext
procedure miracleSort(A : array of items)
    // Wait for a miracle to sort the array
    waitForMiracle()
    if isSorted(A) then
        return A
    else
        keepWaiting()
    end if
end procedure

function isSorted(A)
    for i := 0 to length(A) - 2 do
        if A[i] > A[i + 1] then
            return false
        end if
    end for
    return true
end function

procedure waitForMiracle()
    // Implementation left to the universe
end procedure

procedure keepWaiting()
    // Continue to have boundless optimism
end procedure
```
