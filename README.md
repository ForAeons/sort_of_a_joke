# SortOfAJoke: A Collection of Theoretical and Humorous Sorting Algorithms

## Inspiration

This repository is inspired by [Ardens](https://www.youtube.com/@Ardens.) and his video on the [forbidden sorting algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktgxMtWMflU&t=487s). Please check out his channel and video!

## Description

Welcome to HumorSort, a repository dedicated to the lighter side of computer science algorithms. Here, we explore the conceptual and often humorous sorting algorithms that stem from both pop culture and theoretical computer science musings. These algorithms are not intended for practical use, but rather for entertainment and educational purposes, to illustrate algorithmic concepts and to inspire curiosity about the field of computer science.

Below is a table showcasing the sorting algorithms contained within this repository, along with their theoretical time complexities, space complexities, and notes on their stability â€” all presented with a tongue-in-cheek approach.

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Stability | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Bogo Sort | O((n+1)!) | O(1) | Not applicable | Randomly permutes until sorted |
| Quantum Bogo Sort | O(1) | O(1) | Not applicable | Sorts by destroying unsorted universes |
| Stalin Sort | O(n) | O(1) | Not applicable | Removes out-of-order elements |
| Thanos Sort | O(n) | O(1) | Not applicable | Randomly removes half of the elements |
| Bogobogo Sort | Worse than factorial | O(1) | Not applicable | Recursive Bogo Sort variant |
| Intelligent Design Sort | O(1) | O(1) | Stable | Assumes a pre-sorted array by design |
| Left To The Reader As Exercise Sort | O(1) | O(1) | Stable | Leaves the sorting as an exercise |
| Natural Selection Sort | Undefined | O(n^2) | Not stable | Evolves the array into sorted state |

Please enjoy this compilation with a sense of humor and a dose of curiosity. While these algorithms may not sort your data efficiently (or at all!), they will certainly sort your understanding of sorting algorithms into a more enlightened state.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding your own humorous or theoretical sorting algorithms. Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the theme of the repository and provide a good chuckle or a moment of pondering.

## Disclaimer

The sorting algorithms presented in this repository are not meant for practical use in software development. They are created for theoretical interest and entertainment purposes only. I hope you found a good laugh out of these sorting algorithms :)
