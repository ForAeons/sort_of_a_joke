# Sorting Algorithms Pseudocode Collection

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Pseudocode Collection! This repository is a curated collection of pseudocode for various sorting algorithms, ranging from classic and efficient algorithms to some humorous and non-practical examples that are just for fun.

## Algorithms Included

- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition the array into two parts.
- **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based sorting technique based on the binary heap data structure.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Bogosort**: Also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, or slowsort, this algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted.
- **Quantum Bogosort**: A humorous take on sorting algorithms that relies on the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to sort the list by destroying all universes where the list is not sorted.

## How to Use This Repository

Each sorting algorithm is presented in a separate markdown file named after the algorithm. For example, `merge-sort.md` contains the pseudocode for Merge Sort.
